# Installation
To install this plugin install it on all your spigot servers, however if advancedban is installed on bungee this will not work. This limitation is being worked on and will most likely be removed later on.You must also have punishment-broadcast in your reportplus config configured correctly.
There is no configuration to install it, just reportplus.
